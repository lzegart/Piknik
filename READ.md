# Project 1: Piknik App
### Developed By Function Junction

## Description:
This app alows the user to map out a piknik plan. The user has several options for food type and type of destination, as well as distance range. 

The code deploys a series of modals, which are launched by the Piknik button on the landing page. 
In the first modal there is a user form in which the user can enter their location and answer a few choice questions about range, food, and destination. 
In the second modal the user sees a container with 3 cards; the first with starting address, the second two display address, images, and descriptions or information about the chosen locations. 
The final page will display a map with the user's starting point, food pick-up point, and destination point drawn out. 
On each page is a Piknik button which reveals the following modal.


## Technologies Used:
* Employs a CSS framework called Foundation.
    * Uses modals, input forms, a footer, and cards to display content.
* Is interactive: uses a form to obtain user input and responds in following modal.
* Uses at least two server-side APIs.
    * APIs are obtained with the .fetch method.
    * The MapBox API allows us to map out our locations with lat. and long. inputs.
    * The TomTom API allows us to obtain a list of restaurants that are in the categories that the user choses in the input form.
* Uses client-side storage to store data: when the user clicks save, previous search results will be saved and then displayed in the form input modal on click.
